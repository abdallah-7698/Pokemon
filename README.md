## üèó Architecture

This project incorporates the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern, along with a **Navigation Stack** and the **Coordinator Pattern** for managing screen transitions and maintaining a clean separation of concerns in navigation logic.

- **Model**: Represents the data retrieved from APIs or local storage.
- **View**: Handles the UI components and user interactions.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View, managing the app's logic and data flow.
- **Coordinator Pattern**: Ensures that navigation logic is delegated to dedicated coordinators, making the codebase more modular and easier to maintain.

## üõ† Technology Stack

- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Design Pattern**: MVVM, Coordinator Pattern
- **Networking**: Custom Networking Layer
- **Tools**: Xcode, Git
